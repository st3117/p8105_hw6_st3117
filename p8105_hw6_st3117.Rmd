## Problem 2_1

```{r p2_1}

p2_dataset = 
  RCurl::getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>%
    read_csv()

```

## Problem 2_2

```{r p2_2}

homicides =
  p2_dataset %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"), "white"),

  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>% 
  select(uid, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city_state, resolved)


```

## Problem 2_3
```{r p2_3}

         lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-white") %>% 
  select(beta = estimate, p.value, OR, lower, upper) %>%
